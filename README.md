# Flash Chat

The app is a chatting platform for registered users. It is implemented using the Firebase Firestore Real-Time Data Storage backend. A new user is asked to register for an account on the app. After the user registers, he can interact with the other people in the community of the app. The app serves primarily a great tool for discussions regarding any topic similar to a forum. I personally use this application for discussions with my friends.
